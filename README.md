File DMM1.wfs was created with WatchFaceStudio_1.6.10.exe on Windows 11.  

Thanks to Pachi81 for GlucodataHandler Here: https://github.com/pachi81/GlucoDataHandler

I created a very simple watch face with 5 oversized, extra large complications for better viewing experience for the visually impaired for Dexcom G7, xdrip+ companion for the Galaxy watch 7 ,using very specific Complications from glucodata handler app on phone and watch. I'm still learning and the watch face still needs work, but it's functional enough. I will try out the Libre 3 on in in a few weeks too. Anyone wanting to help fix the face is welcome. Installing the watch face on wear os 5 is a bit complicated, and you have to use WatchFaceStudio_1.6.10 program. You Load the file and send it to watch via ADB using the Function "Run on Watch" in the Watchfacestudio App. I will try to find detailed instrucions on how to install the watch face. My hope is that ing a watch face developer can take this idea to the next level and make the face better and the install process easier. This watch face complications uses very specific glucodataandler customization. Sooo, Warning !! Other customizations will NOT look right and the font will be tiny or ridiculously oversized. Also when touching the watch face, it brings me to alarms and I odn't know who to fix that. 
From the top left Complication going accross using Glucodatahandler specific Customizations are as follows. 
1. Glucose and Trend (big and colored),
2. Delta big,
3. IOB
4. Glucose time stamp
5. Samsung Timer
