# Latest News
I've upload watch faces to google play store for testing. I Need watch face testers prior to getting the faces published so if you interested. Go to the current release page for more information. [https://github.com/sderaps/DMM/releases/tag/v1.0.2](https://github.com/sderaps/DMM/releases/tag/v1.0.2)


 


## Wear OS Watch Faces Designed for Glucodatahandler Customizations for use with Dexcom, Libre and other CGM's 

**Please Note :** 
My Results with Different Setups:
1. Libre 3, Direct to Juggulco, then sending to xdrip+ for IOB tracking, (Hardware data source as Libre(Patched app) then to Glucodatahandler resulted in Very long unacceptable "unreliable" delays in readings on watch.

2. Libre 3, using xdrip+ Hardware data Source(Web Follower), worked well with Glucodatahandler, and tracking insulin in xdrip+, but you need reliable WIFI. SO NOT GOOD FOR ME!!! 
3. Dexcom G7 to xdrip+ Hardware Data Source (Companion App) works very well with min delays. I'm assuming Dexcom  Share Results would be about the same.  
 
**Xdrip+** is my Main Go to Software for Diabetes Management using the Predictive Simulation Graphs showing Insulin Action, IOB, and Recording Insulin Dosing.

****Installation Instructions for Installing Your own Created Watch Face or Editing one of mine. Using the .wfs File using the (RUN ON DEVICE) command**

Samsung Watch Face Studio Gave me allot of problems connecting to my watches during the install "Run On Device", I had to spend quite allot of time trying to install the watch face over and over again. Here are the Steps:

Step 1. Connect your watch and computer to the same Wi-Fi network

Step 2. On your Watch Go to Settings/Connections and Turn off Bluetooth.

Step 3. Enable Developer Options on Watch go to Settings > About device > Software info, then tap the Build number until “Developer options enabled” appears on the screen. Swipe the screen "left to right" to Go back and select Developer Options at the bottom of /settings

Step 4. Put your watch on a usb charger and open Developer Options select “Stay awake when charging” select “ADB Debugging” select “wireless debugging then check wireless debugging in enabled,
 
  on the next screen, Now ensure WIFI address is the same on both computer and watch, scroll down and select Allow. It will bring you back to the previous screen.

Step 5. Now go to Samsung Watch Face Studio on PC load the file *.WFS then select “Run on Device” Click + next to (scan devices) Add your ip address from your watch (example 192.168.1.106) Then add port number that is after your ip: (example 34669) Then click + on the watch to (Pair new device) Add Pairing code from watch to pairing code empty slot in watch face studio. Then Add Pairing Port Number from ip address at the bottom after Example (192.168.1.106:36749) then enter (36749)

Then select ok in watch face studio, and then click on the Your Watch in Devices and the File will be sent to your watch and the face will appear on your watch in about 16 to 20 seconds. If your waiting more than 2 minutes. Most likely something went wrong with the installation. Close Watch Face Studio and try Again. Persistence will get the Job done, Don't give up!!

This watch background are basic because I cannot create an .apk installation file. So If you want to edit the Watch face background in Watch Face Studio, I've uploaded a few you can choose from, Just put the .png files in your hard drive watch back ground directory in watch studio and add them. 

## Troubleshooting Watch Face Installation! 

1. "Run of Device" Does nothing and Runs forever! 
Note:  If "Run on Device" is trying to send the watchface to watch and does nothing for over 2 minutes. Do This! 

2. Close out Watch Face Studio and Reboot PC

3. Go to Watch and "Revoke debugging Authorizations in Developer Settings

4. Turn Off Wireless Debugging

5. Turn Off ADB Debugging

6. Turn Off Smart Watch and boot again.

7. On Watch Make sure Bluetooth is Off

8. Turn "ON" WIFI and Make Sure Wifi is the Same Address on both Watch and PC. 

9. Open Watch Face Studio on PC, and load the watch face

10. Click "Run on Watch" then select the "+"

11. Now go back to watch, and turn on ADB Debugging, Click on Check Mark to Allow. 

12. Go to Wireless Debugging, Toggel it ON, Then Click "allow" for Network.

13. Scroll Down and follow procedure Described In (Step 6 Installation Instructions.

This Should Work, If Not, Keep Doing this same procedure over and over until it works.  
  
Remember, after Successful Installation. Disable, ADB and Wireless Debugging, Disable Wifi and Enable Bluetooth. Also make sure "Stay Awake While Charging" is turned OFF in Developer Setting. 

As you can see, from the above I had allot of problems installing these watch faces. But with persistence it worked. I'm sorry I don't know how to make this easier. I spend endless hours trying to solve, The Troubleshooting Above seemed to fix the issue. On Samsung Developer Site, you will be able to see I'm not the only one with this issue and they really offered no Help.
