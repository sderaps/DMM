Information We Collect

Personal Information:
We do NOT collect any Personal Information about you. “Personal Information” refers to identifiable information such as your name, address, calendar entries, contact details, files, photos, etc. The only exception is that we may store email addresses from users who are “opted in” for the internal testing phase of our watch face before it’s approved on Google Play. If you are not an internal tester, we will not have your email.

Non-Personal Information:
Our watch faces are created using Samsung Watch Face Studio, which may collect data independently. For details on their data collection practices, please refer to the Samsung Watch Face Studio privacy policy.

Location Services:
We do NOT request, collect, or access your location information.

Third-Party Apps/Links:
Our Google Play store includes links to third-party applications, such as Glucodatahandler for mobile and Wear OS. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties and recommend that you review their privacy policies.

Security:
We prioritize the security of your information. Although we do not collect Personal Information, we implement administrative, physical, and electronic measures to protect any Non-Personal Information from unauthorized access and use.

Your Privacy:
We do not store or retain any Personal Information that could identify you, except for email addresses collected during the testing phase prior to Google Play approval. We do not share or sell any user-specific data to third parties. Our goal is to ensure that we do not house or store personal information unnecessarily.
